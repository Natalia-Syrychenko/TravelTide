This project showcases customer segmentation analysis for **TravelTide**, a fictional travel company. The analysis was performed to categorize customers into meaningful segments based on various demographic and behavioral factors. This segmentation allows for better understanding of the customer base, enabling more targeted marketing and business strategies.

## Project Overview 

The TravelTide project focuses on segmenting customer data to provide data-driven recommendations that help enhance customer retention. The project is carried out for TravelTide, a fast-growing e-booking startup that has seen steady growth since its inception in 2021. The goal is to support the Head of Marketing, Elena Tarrant, by understanding customer behavior and creating personalized marketing strategies to encourage customers to sign up for the company's new rewards program.

The project is divided into four main stages, each building on the previous one:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Feature Engineering**
- **Customer Segmentation**
- **Presentation of Results**
  
### Key Customer Segments:

- **Business Traveler (18.34%):** *Free Access to Airport Lounge*
- **Luxury Travelers (18.19%):** *Free hotel night*
- **Hesitant Customers / Early bookers (16.09%):** *Free cancellation*
- **Solo (15.94%):** *Free checked bag*
- **Budget Travelers (14.09%):** *Discount on excursions and car rental*
- **Loyal Customers (11.22%):** *Free Airport Transfers*

- A significant portion of solo travelers fall into the 36-50 age range.
- Loyal customers are primarily single, while business and luxury travelers tend to be married.
- Parenting status shows that the majority of business travelers do not have children, while most loyal customers do.
