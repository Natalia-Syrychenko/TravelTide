This project showcases customer segmentation analysis for **TravelTide**, a fictional travel company. The analysis was performed to categorize customers into meaningful segments based on various demographic and behavioral factors. This segmentation allows for better understanding of the customer base, enabling more targeted marketing and business strategies.

## Project Overview

The customer segmentation is visualized through a dashboard created using data visualization techniques. The segments are categorized by:
- **Age Group**
- **Marital Status**
- **Parenting Status**
- **Gender**
  
### Key Customer Segments:
- **Business Traveler** (18.34%)
- **Luxury Travelers** (18.19%)
- **Solo Travelers** (15.94%)
- **Hesitant Customers/Early Bookers** (16.09%)
- **Budget Travelers** (14.09%)
- **Loyal Customers** (11.22%)

## Tools and Technologies
- **Tableau**: Used for creating the interactive dashboard
- **SQL**: Used for querying and extracting relevant data

## Data Insights

  Through the segmentation, the following insights were gathered:
- Business travelers and luxury travelers make up the largest customer groups.
- A significant portion of solo travelers fall into the 36-50 age range.
- Loyal customers are primarily single, while business and luxury travelers tend to be married.
- Parenting status shows that the majority of business travelers do not have children, while most loyal customers do.
